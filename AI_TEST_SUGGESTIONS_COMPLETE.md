## 💡 Example Analysis

### Input: Weight Calculation Failure

**Execution Log:**
```
Test failed at step 5: Weight calculation incorrect
Expected: 12,450 lbs
Got: 12,750 lbs
Error: Weight exceeds maximum takeoff weight limit
```

### Output: Analysis Results

**Failure Type:** Boundary Violation
**Confidence:** 70%

**Root Cause #1** (85% likelihood)
Fuel density calculation using standard day conditions instead of actual temperature
- Evidence: Log contains 'fuel', 'temperature', 'weight'
- Affected: FuelCalculator, WeightAndBalance
- Regulatory Impact: 14 CFR §23.2005 compliance risk

**Suggestion #1** (Priority 1, 4 hours)
Update fuel density calculation to use actual ambient temperature
- Code: `backend/services/fuel_calculator.py:45`
- Steps: Review lookup table, verify sensor integration, test extremes

**Root Cause #2** (70% likelihood)
Passenger weight average outdated (old FAA standard)
- Affected: PassengerWeightModule

**Suggestion #2** (Priority 2, 1 hour)
Update passenger weight average to current FAA standard (190 lbs)
- Code: `backend/config.py:23`
- Steps: Update constant, re-run tests, update documentation

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Adding New Patterns

1. Edit `backend/app/knowledge/failure_patterns.json`
2. Add new pattern following the schema
3. Restart backend: `docker compose restart backend`
4. Test with matching failure log

### Monitoring

**Check Analysis Stats:**
```bash
GET /api/test-cases/analysis-stats
```

**Review Feedback:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM suggestion_feedback
WHERE helpful = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
1. Analysis returns low confidence → Add more specific patterns
2. No suggestions displayed → Check execution log format
3. Frontend not loading → Verify backend is running
4. API errors → Check authentication token
