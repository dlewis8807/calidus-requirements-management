# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Current Status

✅ All Week 1 files created and committed locally
✅ Commit message generated and applied
⏳ Ready to push to GitHub

## Push Command

You need to authenticate and push to GitHub. Run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/z/Documents/CALIDUS

# Option 1: If you have SSH key configured
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:zozisteam/cls-requirement_management.git
git push -u origin main

# Option 2: If you prefer HTTPS (will prompt for credentials)
git push -u origin main
```

## If This is Your First Push to This Repo

You may need to force push if the remote has different history:

```bash
# Pull any existing changes first (recommended)
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Or force push (use with caution)
git push -u origin main --force
```

## Authentication

### Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic) with `repo` scope
3. When prompted for password, use the token instead

### Using SSH Key

```bash
# Check if you have SSH key
ls -la ~/.ssh

# If not, generate one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy the output and add to: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

3. **Run the project locally**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/z/Documents/CALIDUS
   docker compose up -d --build
   docker compose exec backend python init_db.py
   docker compose exec backend pytest -v --cov=app
   ```

4. **Verify tests pass**:
