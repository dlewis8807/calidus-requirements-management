# 🤖 AI Agent: Requirement Management & Traceability Assistant

## 🎯 Objective
Develop an agentic framework that automates and maintains end-to-end traceability between:
- Requirements (Technical, System, Certification, AHLR)
- Design elements
- Test cases
- Verification results
- Change requests / Risks

The goal is to ensure full compliance and continuous traceability across all stages — from aircraft-level requirements down to test execution records, as shown in Enovia requirement structures.



## 📘 Context
We are managing 15,000+ requirements within ENOVIA:
- Technical Specifications  
- System Requirements  
- Certification Requirements  
- Aircraft High-Level Requirements (AHLR)  

These are linked across multi-level structures (/Users/z/Documents/CALIDUS/regulations.md) with verification objects such as test cases, test results, and execution records.



## 🧠 Core Capabilities of the Agentic framework

### 1. 🔗 Traceability Intelligence
- Automatically map and maintain traceability between:
  - Requirements ↔ Design
  - Technical Specifications  
  - System Requirements  
  - Certification Requirements  
  - Aircraft High-Level Requirements (AHLR)  
  - Requirements ↔ Test Cases
  - Test Cases ↔ Results  
- Detect missing, broken, or circular trace links.
- Suggest new trace links based on semantic and contextual similarity.

### 2. 🧩 Requirement Categorization
- Auto-classify each requirement by type:
  -Technical specification
  -System requirements
  -Certification requirements
  -Aircraft high Level Requirements (AHLR)
- Use natural language processing to detect intent and assign categories.

### 3. 🧭 Compliance Checking
- Cross-check each requirement against regulatory and certification standards (/Users/z/Documents/CALIDUS/regulations.md).  
- Highlight gaps, non-conformities, or ambiguous wording.
- Suggest rewrites for unclear requirements.

### 4. ⚙️ Impact Analysis
- When a requirement changes, identify which related items (designs, tests, documents) are affected.  
- Rank impact severity and propagation depth.

### 5. 🧪 Automated Test Case Generation
- Generate test cases or acceptance criteria from textual requirements.
- Identify:
  - Missing test coverage
  - Redundant tests
  - Conflicting test objectives

### 6. 🔍 Ambiguity & Duplication Detection
- Flag ambiguous or non-verifiable requirements.
- Detect duplicate or overlapping requirements using semantic similarity clustering.


## 🧩 Desired Outputs
The Agentic Framework should produce:
1. Traceability Map  
   - Graph or matrix linking requirements, design elements, and test cases.  
2. Impact Report  
   - List of items affected by any modified requirement.  
3. Compliance Dashboard  
   - Requirements grouped by regulatory standard with gap analysis.  
4. Coverage Summary  
   - % of requirements verified, tested, or missing coverage.  
5. Suggested Trace Links / Test Cases  
   - AI-generated recommendations from multi models with confidence scores.



## ⚙️ Data Inputs
- Exported Enovia data (/Users/z/Documents/CALIDUS/file_extensions.md, JSON, CSV, XML, API feeds):
  - Requirement objects
  - Test plans / Test results
  - Verification records
  - Change requests
- External standards or reference documents (PDF or structured text).


## 🧩 Technical Implementation Ideas
- NLP Models: `bert-base`, `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, or domain fine-tuned model (e.g., aerospace BERT).
- Embedding + Similarity Search: Vector database (Weaviate / Milvus).
- Change Propagation: Graph-based dependency analysis using NetworkX.
- Compliance Mapping: Rule-based + ML hybrid referencing stored regulation libraries.
- Frontend Integration: Connect to Enovia or PLM system via REST APIs or Bolt interface.



## 💬 Example User Prompts
- “Show me all requirements not covered by any test case.”  
- “Generate new trace links for FAA 23.1045(a).”  
- “Highlight performance requirements affected by change in cooling system spec.”  
- “Detect ambiguous wording in certification requirements.”  
- “Summarize test coverage completeness per AHLR section.”



## 🧭 Long-Term Goal
Develop an autonomous traceability engine that:
- Continuously synchronizes with Enovia and 3dexperience.  
- Maintains link integrity through model-based trace graphing.  
- Provides real-time compliance insights and automated verification coverage reports.
