## Sample Output

### Test Case: Weight Calculation Failure

**Input Log:**
```
Test failed at step 5: Weight calculation incorrect
Expected: 12,450 lbs
Got: 12,750 lbs
Error: Weight exceeds maximum takeoff weight limit

The test calculated fuel weight at 600 lbs based on standard temperature,
but actual temperature sensor reading shows 95°F which affects fuel density.
Passenger average weight used was 170 lbs per FAA old standard.
```

**Analysis Results:**

**Failure Type:** `boundary_violation`
**Confidence Score:** 70%

**Root Causes:**
1. **Fuel density calculation using standard day conditions instead of actual temperature**
   - Likelihood: 85%
   - Affected Components: FuelCalculator, WeightAndBalance
   - Regulatory Impact: 14 CFR §23.2005 compliance risk

2. **Passenger weight average outdated (old FAA standard)**
   - Likelihood: 70%
   - Affected Components: PassengerWeightModule

**Suggestions:**
1. **[Priority 1] Update fuel density calculation to use actual ambient temperature**
   - Details: Modify FuelCalculator to accept temperature parameter and use correct density tables
   - Code Locations: `backend/services/fuel_calculator.py:45`, `backend/utils/density_tables.py`
   - Verification Steps:
     1. Review fuel density lookup table implementation
     2. Verify temperature sensor integration
     3. Test with extreme temperature values (-40°C to +50°C)
   - Estimated Effort: 4.0 hours

2. **[Priority 2] Update passenger weight average to current FAA standard (190 lbs)**
   - Details: Update PASSENGER_WEIGHT_AVG constant per FAA AC 120-27F
   - Code Locations: `backend/config.py:23`
   - Verification Steps:
     1. Update configuration constant
     2. Re-run all weight calculation tests
     3. Update documentation
   - Estimated Effort: 1.0 hours

## Technical Architecture

### Reasoning Flow

```
1. Input: Test Case + Execution Log
   ↓
2. Extract Failure Information
   - Error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Keywords (aerospace terms, units, errors)
   ↓
3. Classify Failure Type
   - Assertion Error
   - Timeout
   - Boundary Violation
   - Integration Error
   - etc.
   ↓
4. Pattern Matching
   - Match against knowledge base
   - Calculate similarity scores
   - Rank matches
   ↓
5. Root Cause Analysis
   - Generate hypotheses
   - Check evidence
   - Calculate likelihood
   ↓
6. Suggestion Generation
   - Create actionable steps
   - Prioritize by impact
   - Estimate effort
   ↓
7. Output: Comprehensive Report
   - Root causes with evidence
   - Prioritized suggestions
   - Confidence score
```

### Pattern Matching Algorithm

**Scoring Weights:**
- Regex Pattern Match: 40%
- Keyword Overlap: 30%
- Requirement Type Match: 20%
- Category Match: 10%

**Threshold:** 50% minimum score for pattern match

### Confidence Calculation

```python
confidence = (pattern_score + root_cause_likelihood) / 2
```

- High confidence: > 0.7 (Strong pattern match + high likelihood)
- Medium confidence: 0.5 - 0.7 (Partial matches)
- Low confidence: < 0.5 (Generic suggestions only)
