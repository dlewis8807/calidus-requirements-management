    """
    Traverse parent links up to specified depth
    Returns list of parent requirements that would be affected
    """
    affected = []
    queue = [(requirement_id, 0)]
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        req_id, current_depth = queue.pop(0)
        if current_depth >= depth or req_id in visited:
            continue

        visited.add(req_id)

        # Find parent links
        parents = db.query(TraceabilityLink).filter(
            TraceabilityLink.target_id == req_id
        ).all()

        for parent_link in parents:
            parent_req = db.query(Requirement).get(parent_link.source_id)
            affected.append({
                'requirement': parent_req,
                'depth': current_depth + 1,
                'link_type': parent_link.link_type
            })
            queue.append((parent_req.id, current_depth + 1))

    return affected
```

**Downstream Traversal** (find affected children):
```python
def find_downstream_impact(requirement_id, depth=10):
    """
    Traverse child links down to specified depth
    Includes test cases
    """
    affected = []
    affected_tests = []
    queue = [(requirement_id, 0)]
    visited = set()

    while queue:

        if current_depth >= depth or req_id in visited:
            continue

        visited.add(req_id)

        # Find child links
        children = db.query(TraceabilityLink).filter(
            TraceabilityLink.source_id == req_id
        ).all()

        for child_link in children:
            child_req = db.query(Requirement).get(child_link.target_id)
            affected.append({
                'requirement': child_req,
                'depth': current_depth + 1,
                'link_type': child_link.link_type
            })
            queue.append((child_req.id, current_depth + 1))

        # Find test cases
        tests = db.query(TestCase).filter(
            TestCase.requirement_id == req_id
        ).all()
        affected_tests.extend(tests)

    return affected, affected_tests
```

**Risk Score Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_risk_score(upstream_count, downstream_count, test_count, priority):
    """
    Calculate risk score (0-100) based on impact metrics
    """
    # Weight factors
    upstream_weight = 0.3
    downstream_weight = 0.3
    test_weight = 0.2
    priority_weight = 0.2

    # Normalize counts (assuming max 100 requirements affected)
    upstream_score = min(upstream_count / 100, 1.0) * 100
    downstream_score = min(downstream_count / 100, 1.0) * 100
    test_score = min(test_count / 200, 1.0) * 100

    # Priority score
    priority_scores = {
        'CRITICAL': 100,
        'HIGH': 75,
        'MEDIUM': 50,
        'LOW': 25
    }
    priority_score = priority_scores.get(priority, 50)

    # Weighted sum
    risk_score = (
        upstream_score * upstream_weight +
        downstream_score * downstream_weight +
        test_score * test_weight +
        priority_score * priority_weight

    tested_requirements INTEGER NOT NULL,
    coverage_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
    by_type JSONB,  -- Store breakdown by type
    by_priority JSONB,  -- Store breakdown by priority
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_coverage_history_date ON coverage_history(date);
```

**Populate Coverage History** (cron job or manual):
```python
# Run daily to track coverage over time
def record_coverage_snapshot():
    stats = calculate_coverage_stats()
    coverage_record = CoverageHistory(
        date=datetime.now().date(),
        total_requirements=stats['total'],
        tested_requirements=stats['tested'],
        coverage_percentage=stats['percentage'],
        by_type=stats['by_type'],
        by_priority=stats['by_priority']
    )
    db.add(coverage_record)
    db.commit()
```

### SQL Queries

**Coverage by Type and Priority**:
```sql
SELECT
    r.type,
    r.priority,
    COUNT(r.id) as total_requirements,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tc.requirement_id) as tested_requirements,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT tc.requirement_id)::DECIMAL / COUNT(r.id) * 100, 2) as coverage_percentage
FROM requirements r
LEFT JOIN test_cases tc ON r.id = tc.requirement_id
GROUP BY r.type, r.priority
ORDER BY r.type, r.priority;
```

**Requirements Without Tests**:
```sql
SELECT
    r.id,
    r.requirement_id,
    r.title,
    r.type,
    r.priority,
    r.category
FROM requirements r
LEFT JOIN test_cases tc ON r.id = tc.requirement_id
WHERE tc.id IS NULL
ORDER BY
    CASE r.priority
        WHEN 'Critical' THEN 1
        WHEN 'High' THEN 2
        WHEN 'Medium' THEN 3
        WHEN 'Low' THEN 4
    END;
```

- Test compliance mapping workflow
- Test export functionality (Excel, PDF)

### Performance Tests
- Graph with 10,000+ nodes renders in <5s
- Impact analysis completes in <2s
- Coverage dashboard loads in <2s
- Heatmap renders in <1s

### User Acceptance Testing
- Demo with stakeholders weekly
- Collect feedback on visualizations
- Iterate on UX improvements

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Large graph performance issues | High | Implement lazy loading, pagination, depth limits |
| Export file size too large | Medium | Add compression, pagination for exports |
| NLP model latency (ambiguity detection) | Low | Make feature optional, use caching |
| Database query performance | Medium | Add indexes, optimize queries, use caching |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Feature complexity underestimated | High | Prioritize MVP features, defer nice-to-haves |
| Dependency on external APIs | Low | Use mock data for development |
| Testing time insufficient | Medium | Continuous testing, automated tests |
