## Document Information

**File Name**: `14 CFR Part 23 (in effect on 3-31-2017).pdf`
**Regulation**: 14 CFR Part 23
**Title**: Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category Airplanes
**Effective Date**: March 31, 2017
**File Size**: 2.8 MB
**Authority**: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
**Country**: United States

## Overview

This document contains the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 23, which establishes airworthiness standards for normal category airplanes. These regulations define the design, construction, and performance requirements for certification of small airplanes.

## Regulatory Context

**14 CFR Part 23** is one of the primary certification standards for:
- Normal category airplanes
- Small aircraft (typically under 19,000 lbs / 8,618 kg)
- Non-aerobatic operations
- General aviation aircraft

## Key Areas Covered

The regulation typically includes requirements for:

### Aircraft Design
- Structural design and loads
- Flight characteristics and controllability
- Stability requirements
- Stall characteristics

### Systems
- Flight control systems
- Powerplant installation
- Fuel systems
- Electrical systems
- Hydraulic systems
- Avionics integration

### Performance
- Takeoff performance
- Climb performance
- Landing performance
- Emergency procedures

### Safety
- Emergency egress
- Fire protection
- Crashworthiness
- Equipment and systems safety

## Relationship to Other Regulations

**Related Standards**:
- **DO-178C**: Software considerations for airborne systems
- **DO-254**: Hardware design assurance
- **AS9100**: Quality management for aerospace
- **14 CFR Part 21**: Certification procedures
- **14 CFR Part 25**: Transport category airplanes (larger aircraft)

## Usage in CALIDUS
